## TelegramBotИИ

["Rudi_Fox"](#TbotИИ)
- -this is my faithful assistant. I wanted to create a telegram bot that you can have a great chat with. I connected it to artificial intelligence via APIkay and brought the idea to life as a fox. <a href="https://github.com/ImagicVlad/ImagicVlad/blob/main/TelegramBot%D0%98%D0%98_txt" target="_blank">First project </a> is quite simple. Answers us in writing, has the characterization of “Хозяин”(owner) and addresses us as a loyal friend. But.. something was missing. <a href="https://github.com/ImagicVlad/ImagicVlad/blob/main/TelegramBot%D0%98%D0%98_gs" target="_blank"> Second project </a> involved converting text into audio. I gave the bot the ability to respond with a voice and it became much more interesting to communicate with it.

## TelegramBot_MM

<a href="https://github.com/ImagicVlad/ImagicVlad/blob/main/TelegramBot_MM" target="_blank">"MinterMoney" </a>
- -this is an assistant in investments. It calculates interest on your savings every day and sends you a notification at 00:00. The goal was to create a bot that clearly shows your daily income. You can enter data into it (amount, annual interest rate) and use several commands (/cash, /sum, /reset). This bot has been a great help to me in tracking my savings. 

<a id="Bot_Case"></a>
## Bot_Case
<a href="https://github.com/ImagicVlad/ImagicVlad/blob/main/TelegrammBot_Case" target="_blank">"Bot_Case" </a> 
- -In it you can open and buy csgo cases and try to increase your balance. This bot remembers all the data, and after the restart everything will remain as it was. This bot is the same for everyone (if one person bought a case and spent money, the same for another). It has built-in administrator capabilities, with which you can top up your balance.

<a id='Repl'></a>
## Replit
- In grades 8-9 I studied at <a href="https://replit.com/@Vladmagic" target="_blank">"Replit" </a>. There are many different codes with matrices, arrays... That's where I made my first bot with AI.
